```
This Hangman game is a simple console-based game implemented in C++. The goal of the game is to guess a secret word by suggesting letters.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Displays hangman art as you make incorrect guesses.
- Tracks the letters you've guessed to avoid duplicates.
- Shows the progress of your guesses with underscores for unguessed letters.
- Provides feedback on whether your guess is correct or incorrect.
- Ends the game with a win if you guess all the letters correctly or a loss if you run out of lives.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Run the compiled executable.

## How to Play

1. A random word is chosen from the word list.
2. Guess a letter by entering it in the console.
3. The game will display your current progress, hangman art, and feedback on whether your guess is correct.
4. Continue guessing letters until you win by guessing the word or lose by running out of lives.

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++) installed on your system.
